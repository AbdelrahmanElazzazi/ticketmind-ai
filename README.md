# 📌 Overview

TicketMind is an AI-powered customer support automation platform that integrates with Zendesk to automatically resolve customer support tickets using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Instead of relying solely on an LLM, TicketMind retrieves relevant knowledge from Pinecone, generates grounded responses using Google Gemini, evaluates response confidence, and intelligently decides whether to:

- ✅ Automatically publish the response
- 👨‍💻 Route the ticket for Human Review

The platform also includes real-time monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana, making it suitable for production-oriented AI workflows.

# 🏗️ System Architecture

![Architecture](docs/screenshots/architecture.png)

TicketMind follows a modular AI architecture where incoming support tickets are processed through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline before either being automatically published or routed to human review.

📖 More Details

👉 [System Architecture](docs/01-System-Architecture.md)

---

# 🧠 RAG Pipeline

![RAG Pipeline](docs/screenshots/rag-pipeline.png)

Each incoming ticket is:

1. Embedded using Gemini Embeddings.
2. Retrieved from Pinecone Vector Database.
3. Passed to Google Gemini for grounded answer generation.
4. Evaluated based on confidence.
5. Automatically approved or routed to Human Review.

📖 More Details

👉 [RAG Pipeline Documentation](docs/02-RAG-Pipeline.md)

---

# 👨‍💻 Human Review Workflow

Low-confidence AI responses are automatically routed to a review queue.

Support agents can:

- Review
- Edit
- Approve
- Reject

responses before publishing them back to Zendesk.

👉 [Human Review Workflow](docs/03-Human-Review.md)

# 📊 Monitoring

TicketMind includes built-in observability using Prometheus and Grafana.

Tracked Metrics include:

- Total Tickets
- Auto Approved Tickets
- Human Review Tickets
- Rejected Tickets
- Average Response Time
